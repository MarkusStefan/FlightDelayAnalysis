Hey there! Thank you for viewing my personal Repository. Here, I intend to upload Data Analysis, and as I advance, some Data Science and ML projects!


I started this project on the one hand to practice Data Analysis in R, and on the other hand to demonstrate the skills acquired from the Google Data Analytics Certificate Course hosted on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). The data set was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/undersc0re/flight-delay-and-causes/metadata?select=Flight_delay.csv%22). Originally, the data set comes form the [U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)](https://www.bts.gov/).

A description for the original column labels can be looked up by clicking the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/undersc0re/flight-delay-and-causes?select=Flight_delay.csv).

The attempt to analyze the data set in a Spreadsheet (Excel) failed due to its high volume. I personally decided to use R over SQL because R is more functional and also allows me to visualize the data.

I would love to here your feedback!
